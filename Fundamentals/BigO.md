# Big O Notation

Analyzing the overall performance of an algorithim and how the runtime grows as input size grows.

"worst case scenario"

## Time Complexity
Analizing the runtime of an algorithm as input size increases.
```
Shorthands:
* Aritmetic operations are CONSTANT
* Variable assignments are CONSTANT
* Accessing elements in an array or object is CONSTANT
* Loops: complexity = length of loop x complexity of what is inside of loop
```

## Space Complexity
How much additional memory is needed to run the code.
> Auxiliary Space Complexity --> space required by the algo, not including space taken by the inputs/the algo itself
