# Algo-Practice

## Background
This repository comprises algorithm challenges and solutions, along with data structure foundations broken down into my own language in order to create a deeper understanding of algorithmic structure and problem-solving methods.

All coding solutions are written in JavaScript. Unit tests created using Mocha/Chai along with nyc npm package for test coverage.

## Challenges

- Palindrome Number
- Reverse Integer
- Two Sum
- Roman to Integer
> Sliding Window Pattern:
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
> Arrays + Strings
- Palindrome Check
- Ceaser Cipher Encryptor
- In-Place Shuffle
- Is Unique
- Check Permutation
> Binary Search Trees
- Largest Smaller BST Key
> Dynamic Programming
- Kadane's Algorithm
- Diff Between Two Strings
> 2019 Advent of Code
- Day 1 / The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
